 # Iris-Analysis-Model

This project demonstrates classifying iris flower species using Logistic Regression on the Iris dataset. It covers data loading, preprocessing (scaling), model training, evaluation (accuracy &amp; confusion matrix), and visualizations (pair plots &amp; heatmaps). A beginner-friendly guide to machine learning basics.


## Steps in this Project:
- 1.Data Loading
- 2.Data Preprocessing
- 3.Model Training
- 4.Evaluation
- 5.Visualization

## 1.Data Loading:
The Iris dataset is loaded from scikit-learn, which contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
## 2.Data Preprocessing:
Features are standardized using scaling techniques to ensure that all input features have the same scale, making the model perform better.
## 3.Model Training:
A Logistic Regression model is trained to predict the species of iris flowers based on the features.
## 4.Evaluation:
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix to understand how well it classifies each flower species.
## 5.Visualization:
Visualizations, such as pair plots and heatmaps, are used to better understand the relationships between features and species.
## Tools Used:
- Pandas for data manipulation,
- Scikit-learn for building the model and scaling the features
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations
- Numpy used for numerical computing
