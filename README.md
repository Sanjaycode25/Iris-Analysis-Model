# Iris-Analysis-Model
This project demonstrates classifying iris flower species using Logistic Regression on the Iris dataset. It covers data loading, preprocessing (scaling), model training, evaluation (accuracy &amp; confusion matrix), and visualizations (pair plots &amp; heatmaps). A beginner-friendly guide to machine learning basics.

Steps in this Project:
Data Loading: The Iris dataset is loaded from scikit-learn, which contains features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Data Preprocessing: Features are standardized using scaling techniques to ensure that all input features have the same scale, making the model perform better.
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained to predict the species of iris flowers based on the features.
Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix to understand how well it classifies each flower species.
Visualization: Visualizations, such as pair plots and heatmaps, are used to better understand the relationships between features and species.
This project is great for beginners as it covers essential steps in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python.

Tools Used:
Pandas for data manipulation,
Scikit-learn for building the model and scaling the features
Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations
